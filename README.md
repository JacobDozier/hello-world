GitHub Tutorial

Hello,

I am learning how to use GitHub because I hope to get a job in coding eventually.
I have heard a lot about GitHub and it is the only online collaborative repository I know right now.
I am currently in college but this is my senior year so one more semester to go!
My first major was in aerospace engineering but it was not for me.
The only way I could still change majors and graduate on time was to major in Philosophy.
Philosophy is a great field of study all by itself because of the amazing questions that you run into.

Anyway, I took a c++ class during my AE time and took several logic classes in Philosophy and
discovered that I was drawn to coding even in my free time.
